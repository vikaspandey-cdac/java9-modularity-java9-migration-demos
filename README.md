 Migrating to Java 9 Modules

This  contains the same application in 4 different states:

1. A classic Spring/Hibernate application running on the classpath
2. Reimplementation of this app with Java 9 modules *without* using the Spring/Hibernate libs
3. A port of the classpath based application to a single module running on Java 9 (with automatic modules)
4. Fully modularized version of the Spring/Hibernate app (with automatic modules)
